## What's New

I recently (Aug/2016) ported this project to use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Enjoy fatigue-free React!

## Overview

This is yet another React and Redux based web application starter kit. However, this one attempts to go beyond the typical simple boilerplates, 
by showcasing several great technologies (such as [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux), 
[React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [Babel](http://babeljs.io), 
[Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and [JWT](https://jwt.io)) used together to develop a more complex web application, with features such as 
authentication, navigation, asynchronous data fetching, error handling, caching and pagination, etc.

## Available Scripts
Thanks to [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**


## How Do I ... ?

This project was ported to use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for handling all assets. 
Please refer its [how-to](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md).
